### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have a modern web browser that supports HTML5 and JavaScript.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ping-pong-game.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash

   ```

3. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

4. You're ready to play! Use your keyboard arrow keys to control the paddle and try to score points against the AI opponent.

## Gameplay

The objective of the game is simple: Score points by hitting the ball past your opponent's paddle.

- Use the **Up** and **Down** arrow keys to control your paddle.
- The game has a player paddle (controlled by you) on the left side and an AI opponent on the right side.
- The ball will bounce off the paddles and the top and bottom walls.
- The game ends when one player reaches a certain score or when you decide to exit.

## Project Structure

The project structure is straightforward:

- `index.html`: The HTML file that contains the game's structure and elements.
- `style.css`: The CSS file for styling the game elements.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file containing the game logic and functionality.

## Customization

Feel free to customize this game to make it your own! Here are some ideas:

1. **Graphics**: You can replace the simple shapes with more appealing graphics for the paddles and the ball.

2. **Scoring**: Modify the scoring rules, such as changing the score required to win or implementing a timer-based game.

3. **Difficulty**: Adjust the AI opponent's behavior to make it easier or harder to play against.

4. **Sound**: Add sound effects or background music to enhance the gaming experience.

5. **Themes**: Create different themes or backgrounds for the game to give it a unique look.
